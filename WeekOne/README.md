# CS371-FINAL-PROJECT
Final Project for CS371 - Jiali Graham and Eric Xing

Week One's Progress (3-21-22 to 2-25-22)
  As of right now, we have three files, the Driver_XOR, FC_Layer, Net, and ReLU file. 
  The Driver_XOR file runs the XOR test with an expected output of [0, 1, 1, 0]. 
  FC_Layer runs the data through the layer
  The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) file makes sure that a negative number cannot pass through.
  Net is where the data is inputted, layers are added, and the model is trained
